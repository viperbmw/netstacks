# YAML Workflow Engine - Summary

## What We Built

A **simple, intuitive workflow engine** that lets network engineers create automation workflows using plain YAML - no Python coding required.

## Why This Is Better Than Current MOPs

### Current MOP Problems:
- ❌ Complex JSON configs
- ❌ `{{variable}}` syntax confusing
- ❌ Type errors (str vs list)
- ❌ Hard to debug
- ❌ Requires understanding Python

### New Workflow Solution:
- ✅ Simple YAML syntax
- ✅ Clear step types
- ✅ Built-in conditionals (`on_success`, `on_failure`)
- ✅ Easy to understand flow
- ✅ Custom Python only when needed

## Your Exact Use Case - Solved

```yaml
name: "Maintenance Window"

devices:
  - bms01-bidev.nae05.gi-nw.viasat.io
  - dmsp01-cidev.nae05.gi-nw.viasat.io

steps:
  # Step 1: Check devices online and BGP neighbors match Netbox
  - name: "Verify BGP Neighbors"
    type: check_bgp
    compare_to_netbox: true
    on_success: deploy_stack
    on_failure: send_alert

  # Step 2: Deploy service stack (only if BGP check passed)
  - name: "Deploy Stack"
    id: deploy_stack
    type: deploy_stack
    stack_id: "customer-vpn-stack"
    on_success: send_success_email
    on_failure: send_alert

  # Step 3: Send success email
  - name: "Send Success Email"
    id: send_success_email
    type: email
    to: "ops@company.com"
    subject: "Deployment Complete"
    body: "Service deployed successfully!"

  # Failure handler
  - name: "Send Alert"
    id: send_alert
    type: email
    to: "oncall@company.com"
    subject: "ALERT: Deployment Failed"
    body: "Check the logs"
```

## How It Works

### 1. Define Workflow (YAML)
Create a simple YAML file describing what you want to do

### 2. Test It
```bash
python test_workflow.py workflows/my_workflow.yaml
```

### 3. Execute (Via Web UI - Coming Next)
Click "Execute" button in web interface

## Available Step Types

| Type | What It Does | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `check_bgp` | Verify BGP neighbors | Check count matches Netbox |
| `check_ping` | Ping devices | Verify reachability |
| `check_interfaces` | Check interface status | Verify X interfaces up |
| `deploy_stack` | Deploy service stack | Your existing stacks |
| `run_command` | Run CLI command | Any show/config command |
| `email` | Send email | Success/failure notifications |
| `webhook` | Call HTTP API | Slack, Teams, etc. |
| `custom_python` | Run Python code | Complex custom logic |
| `wait` | Pause execution | Wait for convergence |

## Key Features

### Conditional Flow
```yaml
- name: "Check Something"
  type: check_bgp
  on_success: next_step      # Go here if success
  on_failure: send_alert     # Go here if failed
```

### Variable Substitution
```yaml
- name: "Send Email"
  type: email
  body: |
    Workflow: {workflow_name}
    Time: {timestamp}
    Result: {step_results.previous_step.data.field}
```

### Custom Python (When Needed)
```yaml
- name: "Custom Logic"
  type: custom_python
  script: |
    # Access all previous results
    results = context['step_results']

    # Your custom logic here
    if complex_condition:
        result = {'status': 'success'}
    else:
        result = {'status': 'failed'}
```

## Example Workflows Created

1. **`example_simple.yaml`** - Basic BGP check and email
2. **`example_maintenance.yaml`** - Full maintenance workflow with rollback
3. **`example_custom_python.yaml`** - Shows custom Python validation

## Testing Results

```bash
$ python test_workflow.py workflows/example_simple.yaml

============================================================
Testing Workflow: workflows/example_simple.yaml
============================================================

Workflow Status: COMPLETED

============================================================
Execution Log:
============================================================

✗ Step 1: Check BGP Status
  Status: failed
  Message: BGP check failed

✓ Step 3: Send Alert
  Status: success
  Message: Email sent to oncall@company.com

============================================================
Final Result: Workflow completed successfully
============================================================
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Keep Testing Standalone
- Create more workflow YAML files
- Test with `test_workflow.py`
- Refine the step implementations

### Option 2: Integrate into Netstacks UI
- Add `/workflows` page
- Upload/edit YAML workflows
- Execute and monitor from web UI
- View execution logs

### Option 3: Connect to Real Functions
- Wire up `check_bgp` to your actual BGP checking code
- Connect `deploy_stack` to your existing stack deployment
- Implement email sending
- Add Netbox integration for `compare_to_netbox`

## Rollback Plan

We're on branch `experiment-workflow-engine`. To rollback:

```bash
git checkout main                          # Back to working code
git branch -D experiment-workflow-engine   # Delete experiment
```

## Decision Time

Do you want to:

**A) Keep this approach and integrate it?**
- Replace current MOP system with YAML workflows
- Build simple web UI for workflow management
- Wire up to your existing functions

**B) Try something different?**
- Look at n8n visual workflow builder
- Try a different workflow engine
- Improve current MOP system instead

**C) Test more first?**
- Create more example workflows
- Wire up real device checks
- See how it handles edge cases

## My Recommendation

**Keep this YAML approach** because:
1. ✅ Simple - network engineers will understand it
2. ✅ No external dependencies
3. ✅ Integrates with your existing code
4. ✅ Easy to debug and test
5. ✅ Can build simple web UI for it
6. ✅ Version control friendly (YAML in git)

Next: Build a simple web page to:
- List workflows
- Upload/edit YAML
- Execute workflows
- View execution logs

This would take ~2-3 hours and give you a complete working solution.
