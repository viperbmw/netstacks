## Executive Summary

### The Business

NetStacks is a network automation platform combined with expert consulting services, targeting mid-market enterprises and managed service providers (MSPs) who need to modernize their network operations without the overhead of building in-house automation expertise.

### Value Proposition

- **Open-source platform** with enterprise support options
- **20+ years of network engineering expertise** from founder
- **AI-augmented operations** reducing manual labor by 70-90%
- **Cost savings of 50-80%** vs. enterprise alternatives (SolarWinds, Cisco DNA Center)

### Revenue Streams

1. **Platform Support & Customization** - Annual contracts for NetStacks support
2. **Consulting & Implementation** - Project-based and retainer services
3. **NOC as a Service** - Managed network operations with AI automation (future)

### Target Revenue (Year 2-3)

- Net income target: **$300,000 - $400,000** (after expenses, family payroll)

## Business Model

### Open Core + Services

The primary business model is **Open Core with Professional Services**:

| Component | Model | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| NetStacks Platform | Open Source (Free) | Market penetration, community building |
| Enterprise Support | Annual Subscription | Recurring revenue, customer success |
| Professional Services | Project/Retainer | High-margin expertise delivery |
| NOCaaS | Monthly Subscription | Scalable recurring revenue (Phase 2) |

### Why This Model Works

1. **Low barrier to entry** - Free platform attracts users
2. **Value demonstration** - Users see ROI before paying
3. **Upsell path** - Free → Support → Services → Managed
4. **Sticky revenue** - Support contracts and NOCaaS are hard to switch
5. **High margins** - AI automation reduces labor costs

**Profile:**
- 50-500 network devices

- Compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX)

#### 2. Managed Service Providers (MSPs)

**Profile:**
- Managing networks for 10-100+ clients
- Need white-label solutions
- Want to offer NOC services without building in-house
- Budget: Per-client pricing model

**Ideal Fit:**

- VARs adding managed services

#### 3. Enterprise Network Teams

**Profile:**
- 500+ devices
